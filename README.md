## **Contribution Guidelines**

- **Plagiarism will not be entertained**. Any PR that is found to be suspicious of plagiarised work will not be merged and will be marked as spam.

You just have to comment on the issue, asking to be assigned and the programming language you should be assigned in, and it will be done if found fit.

- You cannot work on any issue that is not assigned to you. Only when you have been assigned, you can start working on it and raise a PR for the same.
